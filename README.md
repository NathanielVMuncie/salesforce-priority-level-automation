# Salesforce Case Study: Lead — Priority Level Automation

A fully automated, end-to-end B2B Lead intake, scoring, and routing system built for Céleste Vineyards across Wix, Make.com, and Salesforce Sales Cloud.

---

## Business Objective

Céleste Vineyards is a fictional mid-sized B2B wine company that required a deterministic Lead intake system to replace manual handling and eliminate inconsistency at the point of pipeline entry.

The primary objectives were:

- **Qualification Enforcement:** Prevent non-business submissions from entering the pipeline entirely — enforced at the Wix form before any data is transmitted.
- **Priority Determination:** Assign a Priority Level to every Lead at creation based on a weighted scoring model reflecting potential business value.
- **Territorial Routing:** Assign each Lead to the correct regional Queue based on geographic territory using Salesforce Assignment Rules.
- **Escalation Control:** Automatically route Priority Level High Leads to the National Sales Director without manual intervention.
- **Zero-Touch Processing:** Ensure all qualification, scoring, and routing decisions are handled automatically from form submission through owner assignment.

Without this system, high-value Leads risked being overlooked, routing was inconsistent, and no standardized Priority Level existed at the point of entry. This architecture enforces immediate scoring, prioritization, and ownership assignment for every B2B Lead.

---

## How the System Works

The automation operates as a linear pipeline across three layers. Each layer owns a distinct responsibility. No layer duplicates the work of another.

```
Wix Form (Qualification Gate)
        |
        | B2B submission only — non-business path locks form, nothing transmits
        ▼
Make.com (Middleware)
        |
        | Normalizes payload, maps fields, creates Lead Record via Salesforce API
        ▼
Salesforce Lead Record Created
        |
        ▼
Lead Assignment Rule
        |
        | Evaluates State/Province → assigns regional Queue
        ▼
After-Save Flow: Lead_Scoring_and_Priority_Level_Assignment
        |
        ▼
Weighted Scoring
Business Type (1–5) + Role (1–5) + Purchasing Timeline (1–5)
        |
        | varTotalScore range: 3–15
        ▼
Priority Assignment
High (≥ 12) | Medium (≥ 8) | Low (< 8)
        |
        ▼
Escalation Check
Priority Level High → OwnerId overridden to Sophia Delgado (National Sales Director)
Priority Level Medium / Low → Regional Queue retained
        |
        ▼
Single DML Write
OwnerId + Priority_Level__c + Lead_Score__c committed to Lead Record
        |
        ▼
Lead owned — pipeline complete
```

## Qualification Gate — Wix Form

The Wix inquiry form is the qualification gate for the entire pipeline. It is the first layer of the automation and the only place where non-business contacts are identified and blocked.

When a prospect selects `Personal/Individual (Non-Business)` from the Business Type field, the form transforms: all remaining fields are hidden and the form becomes unsubmittable. No payload is transmitted to Make.com. No Lead Record is created in Salesforce. The contact never enters the pipeline.

Every Lead Record that exists in Salesforce originated from a B2B submission. No qualification logic, qualification fields, or disqualification paths exist anywhere in the Salesforce layer — they are not needed.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Qualification Gate | Wix | Form-level B2B gate — blocks non-business submissions before transmission |
| Middleware | Make.com | Payload normalization, field mapping, Salesforce API ingestion |
| CRM | Salesforce Sales Cloud | Scoring, priority assignment, escalation, routing |
| Automation | Record-Triggered After-Save Flow | Weighted scoring + priority assignment + escalation override |
| Routing | Lead Assignment Rules + Queues | Territory-based owner assignment |

---

## Scoring Model

Every Lead that reaches Salesforce is scored across three dimensions. Each dimension contributes 1–5 points to `Lead_Score__c`. The composite score determines `Priority_Level__c`.

### Business Type (`Business_Type__c`)

| Picklist Value | Points |
|---|---|
| Premium Wine Distributor | 5 |
| High-End Wine Store | 4 |
| Upscale Restaurant | 3 |
| Specialty Gourmet Grocer | 2 |
| Catering & Event Company | 1 |

### Role (`Role__c`)

| Picklist Value | Points |
|---|---|
| Owner | 5 |
| Purchasing Manager | 4 |
| General Manager | 3 |
| Sales Manager | 2 |
| Event Coordinator | 1 |

### Purchasing Timeline (`Purchasing_Timeline__c`)

| Picklist Value | Points |
|---|---|
| Immediate Need (Contracting) | 5 |
| Short-Term (Within 30 Days) | 4 |
| Evaluating Vendors (Next 90 Days) | 3 |
| Budget Planning (Future Quarter) | 2 |
| Information Gathering | 1 |

### Priority Level Thresholds

| Priority Level | Condition | Score Range |
|---|---|---|
| High | `Lead_Score__c` ≥ 12 | 12–15 |
| Medium | `Lead_Score__c` ≥ 8 | 8–11 |
| Low | Default | 3–7 |

---

## Territorial Routing

The Lead Assignment Rule evaluates `State/Province` on every incoming Lead Record and assigns ownership to one of three regional Queues. The Assignment Rule fires before the Flow and establishes the territorial ownership baseline.

| Region | Queue API Name | States Covered |
|---|---|---|
| East Coast | `East_Coast_Region` | 20 states + DC |
| West Coast | `West_Coast_Region` | 13 states |
| Central | `Central_Region` | 18 states |

All 50 US states and the District of Columbia are covered. No Lead is unassigned by territory.

---

## Escalation

Priority Level High Leads are escalated to **Sophia Delgado**, National Sales Director, via Flow escalation logic. The Flow captures the regional Queue `OwnerId` set by the Assignment Rule, evaluates `varPriorityLevel`, and overwrites `OwnerId` with Sophia Delgado's User ID when Priority Level is High. Priority Level Medium and Low Leads retain regional Queue ownership.

The `Region__c` Formula Field preserves the correct territorial classification on all Lead Records regardless of who owns them — escalated Leads owned by Sophia Delgado still carry the correct regional value for pipeline reporting.

## Core Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| Gate at the Source | Non-business contacts are blocked at the Wix form. Nothing worthless enters the pipeline. |
| Single-DML Pattern | All custom Field writes occur in one Flow Update Records element. No recursive triggers. Governor limit exposure is contained and predictable. |
| Separation of Concerns | Each layer owns exactly one responsibility. Wix qualifies. Make.com ingests. Salesforce scores, prioritizes, and routes. No layer duplicates another. |
| Deterministic Output | Identical input values always produce identical output — Priority Level, Owner, and Score. No subjective assessment. |
| Bulk-Safe Design | Flow logic handles batch Lead creation without violating Salesforce governor limits. |

| Customer Note | `Customer_Note__c` | Text Area | Prospect-submitted free text |
| Region | `Region__c` | Formula (Text) | Territorial classification derived from `State/Province` |
| Lead Created | `Lead_Created__c` | Formula (Date) | Audit timestamp derived from `CreatedDate` |

## Operational Status

- Fully implemented and operational in a Salesforce Developer Edition Org
- Integrated end-to-end: Wix → Make.com → Salesforce
- Six canonical Lead Records validate all paths — Priority Level Low, Medium, and High with escalation across all three regional territories
- Documentation produced via reverse documentation from the live system

---

## Developer Edition Org Context

This system is built in a Salesforce Developer Edition org. Two constraints are documented as scope acknowledgments, not gaps.

**Single active user license.** The org supports one Standard User license, assigned to Sophia Delgado. Regional Queues — `East_Coast_Region`, `West_Coast_Region`, `Central_Region` — operate as proof-of-concept ownership placeholders. In a production deployment, each Queue would contain provisioned named users.

**No production sandbox.** All test records, debug logs, and UAT evidence are produced in the Developer Edition org. Sandbox migration procedures are not demonstrated. This does not affect the correctness or completeness of any automation logic documented in this repository.
